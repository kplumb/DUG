## Installing Python Locally

If you plan on running code on your local machine, then you must install python. A number of packages are required In addition to the base python installation. In particular, we will make extensive use of the numpy and matplotlib packages included as part of the SciPy library. We also require a few tools to help us work efficiently using python, including the ipython shell, an interactive python interpreter; Jupyter notebooks, an interactive python environment tailored for scientific computing; and a text editor. 

Luckily, most of these packages and tools are included as part of the Anaconda python distribution, which is a great python distribution for scientific computation. To install, go to https://www.anaconda.com/download and download the installer for the Python 3.6 version appropriate to your operating system (either Windows, macOS, or Linux). 

The easiest way to test your python installation is to open the Jupyter notebook application. You may need to search for it. When you open Jupyter, the interface will pop up as a tab in your web browser and a terminal will open in the background. Donâ€™t worry about the terminal, just let it do its thing. 

To close Jupyter program, close the tab on your browser, then go to the terminal, which is open, and press ctrl+c and then close the terminal. 

Note that there are many ways to run python programs. Jupyter notebooks is one method that is particularly well suited to scientific analysis, but depending on the problem or your personal preferences another method may be better. We will explore other ways of running python programs in class. You are free to use whatever method you like best for assignments and projects in this course. Python is a tool to help you solve problems and get work done, there is not one right way to interact with it.

A text editor program is also required to edit Python programs.  The default notepad or textEdit applications included with Windows and MacOs respectively are not sufficient. Luckily, there are many good options, a few are listed below:

A nice cross-platform option is Sublime text editor, find it here:  https://www.sublimetext.com/

Notepad++ is another good and free option for windows, find it here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

Atom for MacOS: https://atom.io/
